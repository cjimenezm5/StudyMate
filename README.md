## **Further Improvements**
While StudyMate is functional, the following improvements could make it more versatile and user-friendly:
1. **Expand compatibility with external tools**:
   - Connect the app to other tools that students use such as Google Calendar or Blackboard to further sync their tasks and schedules with the app. 
2. **Develop a GUI for the app**:
   - Improve the overall user experience with more visual tools and representations of the app. Hopefully we can bring our mockups to real life nad include elemnts such as timelines, progress bars etc. 
3. **Gamification**:
   - Add features like productivity streaks amnd achievement badges to keep users motivated and on top of their tasks. 
4. **Expand features**:
   - Increase the app's values to  by addressing user needs; add notifications for assignemnts that aer close to the deadline and incorporate other features for group assignments like sharing tasks among group members. 
5. **Improved storage**:
